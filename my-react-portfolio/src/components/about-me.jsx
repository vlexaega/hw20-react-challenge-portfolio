            <p>Hello World and welcome to my page! I'm a banker turned web developer originally from The Bahamas - but I call 
            New York City home now. I enjoy travelling and spending time at the beach when I can. I'm growing
            my skills in web development and I'm excited to show you my work! Links to some of my recent projects
            can be found below.
